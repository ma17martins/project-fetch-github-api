## Description
This is a project proposed by the DevQuest Course, which consists of a JavaScript module challenge. The goal is to create a search field where a user's name must be entered to access their profile. By clicking the "Search" button or pressing the "Enter" key, the system performs a query through the GitHub API, displaying the user's name, photo, bio description, and repositories.
