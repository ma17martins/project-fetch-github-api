# Project-fetch-github-api

## Description
This is a project proposed by the DevQuest Course, which consists of a JavaScript module challenge. The objective is to create a search field where a user's name must be entered to access their profile. When clicking the “Search” button or pressing the “Enter” key, the system performs a query through the GitHub API, displaying the user's name, photo, bio description, repositories and a list of events carried out in the user's profile and the last commit of each event.
